# Nomination

### Candidate Position  
Matt Smithies – Contributor Seat

### Qualifications  
Matt has been building on Hedera since 2018, starting with early experiments using the Swirlds SDK. In 2020, he led the migration of DOVU into the Hedera ecosystem, where it has become one of the highest-throughput projects on the network — consistently pushing the boundaries of real-world asset (RWA) and ESG infrastructure.

Matt has competed in two major Hedera hackathons, including developing the first proof-of-concept decentralized exchange on the network. He has contributed to and maintained community-driven SDKs, launched production-grade tooling, and architected one of the most efficient retail staking mechanisms within the crypto industry at large.

As CTO of DOVU, Matt is pioneering next-generation systems that transform intent into action. His work spans real-time audit trails, programmable trust flows, and workflow engines that allow various standards — such as carbon methodologies, supply chain certifications, and financial compliance models — to be digitally enforced and tokenized. These systems are built to be modular, supporting diverse identities, services, and platforms across the Hedera ecosystem.

In addition to his technical and product contributions, Matt has actively participated in public-facing community efforts — including speaking at NFT London, joining ecosystem Twitter Spaces, and appearing on podcasts with Hedera community influencers and stakeholders. While his focus remains on building the right product at the right time, Matt is also a confident and thoughtful communicator, ready to bring forward-looking ideas to the ecosystem when the moment calls for it. He is comfortable serving as a visionary voice within the community — not just through code, but through conversation.

### Statement  
Over the past six years, I’ve been privileged to witness and help shape the evolution of Hedera from the builder’s seat. Now, we’re at a turning point.

Our ecosystem has the right primitives: performance, finality, and robust governance. What comes next is delivering **usable infrastructure** — solutions that abstract complexity and empower enterprises and developers to build with confidence.

That’s where my focus lies.

At DOVU, we’ve developed a system that turns intent into verifiable outcomes — enabling standards and multi-party workflows to be seamlessly codified and enforced. I believe this modular model — where trust is **codified, enforced, and issued** across various tokenized outcomes — is the future of enterprise adoption. This vision aligns tightly with the mission of Hiero, as we collectively unlock the potential of digital trust.

If elected, I’ll bring deep implementation knowledge, architectural thinking, and a clear commitment to usability. My goal is to help ensure that our ecosystem becomes the most efficient, scalable, and credible platform for building systems of record in the digital era.
